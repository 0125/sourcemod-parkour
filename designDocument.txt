			1. named checkpoints: beginning, start and finish. Start and finish mandatory for each map
			and beginning as optional to teleport players to before they have unlocked any checkpoints

			the hospital tower at the end
				- start checkpoint should be close to the start of the jumps
			2. checkpoints during the map
	- Visual / in-game
		- Light beam going up in the sky, examples:
				- https://github.com/0125/sourcemod-parkour/issues/7
				- https://youtu.be/sRLKsxwojmI?t=53
