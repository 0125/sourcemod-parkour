Misc
	Disable shove? if possible
	Make it so users cant push each other around
	Remove all props from the map or just weapons

Changing maps
	Maps only change every x seconds with map countdown
	Instead of loading the next map when someone completes it, record their stats, reset their stats and then teleport them back to the start checkpoint, also announce stats
	Possibly have a mapvote command
	
Items
	Items would need to despawn on death because with many deaths the amount of items would pile up and crash the server
	On spawn
		Pills
		Kit
		Weapon without the ability to shoot? 0 ammo just disables being able to hold the weapon

Bugs
	A lot of the maps have skips, these would need to be fixed for stats to not be pointless
	Bug where incapped/hanging off ledge survivor health is set to 0 immediately but there is still a short window of time he can be helped up needs to be fixed

(github) website
	Have a youtube playlist with each map being completed with nosboard on the screen
	
!stats command
	Brings up a menu with options
		Print own stats
			Prints PB, total deaths, total victories for current map in chat. Possibly also victories combined in all maps
		Show map fastest top 10
			Brings up a menu with top 10 fastest times for this map
		Show map least deaths top 10
			Brings up a menu with top 10 leasts times for this map
		Show server top 10
			Top 10 most victories combined in all maps
			

Achievements
	Skins
		Option 1
			Let users unlock different skins based on achievements
				!skins menu which lists the skins and which achievement is required
					eg:
						<zoey> 
						<bill> 
						<francis> 
						<louis> 
						<black skin> completed all maps
						<table model> completed all maps
						<different colour skin> x total victories
			Save skins between maps or even between connects to the server
		
		Option 2
			Applying skins to users in a milestone way without a menu eg: first skin unlocked by completing all maps, and after that by total victories
			Downside to this is users cant tell which milestone is which skin because there is no menu to tell them
			
		Skin sources
			Player model
				!setmodel [SM] Usage: sm_setmodel <#userid|name> [model] Example: !setmodel @me models/props_interiors/table_bedside.mdl 
					Which plugin enables setmodel?
					Find complete list of models
					Find models which could be good to unlock with achievements
			
			Player colour/transparency
				- check funcommands/funcommandsX has commands for changing skins - tested and does not work on l4d2, might work on l4d1
					sm_invisplayer = hides player except for their items
					sm_disco is mentioned in the source thread which does exactly what i need 
				- !freeze sets the player transparency and colour
				- !beacon and sm_beacon_radius without the sound
				- !firebomb also changes the players colour
				- !freezebomb also changes the players colour
